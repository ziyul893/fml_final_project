ECE 8803 FML Final Project 
None of the code need any arguments, just running the .py file should train, print, and save everything that you need!

AE.py: used for training and saving autoencoder that resizes frames in OLIVES to (512,512), then readjusts to (8,8) or (1,2) as needed.

Train_Resnet.py: Training and Saving a ResNet50 model with transfer learning, meaning the weights are frozen

Train_Alexnet.py: Training and saving a AlexNet model with newly initialized weights.

AE_test.py: used for testing output of AE

Test.py: Testing the models generated by the above files, also can append snippets of code in svm.py and bayes.py to run svm or Naive Bayes.

knn.py: can be appended to run knn algo as well, but not needed in this proj.
